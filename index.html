<h1 id="community-fellowship-application-open-savannah-addendum">Community Fellowship Application - Open Savannah - Addendum</h1>
<p>TOPLIINE SUMMARY OF PROPOSED PROJECT:<br>After discussions with city officials, community members, brigade leaders, and Code for America staffers, we’ve decided to move forward in submitting a project application for an inclusive, geotargeted and equitable participatory budgeting (PB) process that would aim to engage typically excluded and marginalized portions of the community on their levels – as well as the entire citizenry at large – in helping decide how at least $187,350,000.00 in General Funds of the City’s budget for FY ’19  would be allocated (with incredibly broad funding powers, but not anarchy). Because of the City’s tourism industry, more than half the budget in total falls into this category.  Melissa Carter of the City’s Office of Budget and Research informed us late Friday (May 4) that the City Manager has given the green light to allow the fellowship project to give the public direct say in how their tax dollars are spent. A citizen-driven steering committee will vet proposals.</p>

<h4 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h4>
<p>In Savannah, our <a href="https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/depleting-the-civic-bank-account/Content?oid=8098067" target="_blank">civic bank account</a> has been depleted. </p>
<p>As a result of an unplanned $12 million revenue shortfall, funding for social services and nonprofit initiatives for the vulnerable (SSP grants) was reduced by approximately 40 percent in 2018, from $1.2 million to less than $800,000.00. The City closed its only two publicly-funded  homeless shelters; it defunded the Rape Crisis Center altogether; it closed its Entrepreneurial Center altogether. It also ended its Women and Minority Small Business Program. It goes without saying that residents weren&#39;t happy about the cuts.</p>
<p>Then, two weeks ago, it was announced that the City actually ended its fiscal year with a <strong>surplus</strong> of $10 million, meaning that the draconian  cuts to  programs to alleviate poverty were esssentially unnecessary. What we face on both sides is a failure to understand or communicate budget operations. We&#39;ve done projects such as openbudgetsav.org, but more than that will be needed to restore the civic bank account to a positive balance. (154 wds)</p>
<h3 id="discovery-work">Discovery work</h3>
<p>The very first time I ever met with City Hall when starting Open Savannah, participatory budgeting was mentioned as a dream thing for the City so that constituents would understand <em>why</em> things work the way they do. That was 13 months ago.</p>
<p>The conversation has continued, but the 2018 budget fiasco mentioned above, made it difficult to implement this year as the budget itself wasn&#39;t even made public until <em>after</em> it had been voted on. There was no public feedback period of any sort. We had no preliminary budget except a &#39;doomsday&#39; one presented as a way to gain support for a fire fee that eventually balanced the budget.</p>
<p>It was not,  in my opinion, any attempt at ill-will, but rather because of a radical restructuring of city departments combined with a costly demerger of police forces from Chatham County. And a gap in communication.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve met three times so far with the Office of Budget since the Community Fellowship was announced. We&#39;ve also visited four neighborhood associations to gather resident feedback. 92 percent of those we surveyed think a participatory budget process would help restore the loss of civic trust, and 81 percent think it would save money overall by preventing duplicative services being funded.</p>
<h3 id="vulnerable-populations-who-this-will-help">Vulnerable populations who this will help</h3>
<ol>
<li>Anyone who wants to start a business but needs help with the process</li>
<li>Homeless or hungry</li>
<li>A more equitable distribution of $200 million in GF revenues that funds anti-poverty initiatives.</li>
<li>Black residents whose districts have been gerrymandered to a point where they have lost political power.</li>
<li>Those living on the poverty line faced with imminent displacement because of the rapid rate of gentrification in the City.</li>
<li>Victims of sexual abuse, assault.</li>
<li>Those who lack transportation to work and need the bus system to run later hours.</li>
<li>Hospitality workers, who account for 30 percent of the workforce, and who have zero municipal rights that guarantee they have transportation to work.</li>
<li>The addicted – The only publicly-funded support net for addiction closed three years ago. </li>
<li>Residents in areas with historically low voter turnouts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-we-ll-work-with-the-city">How we&#39;ll work with the City</h3>
<ul>
<li>We&#39;lll work out of City Hall</li>
<li>The City Manager has officially signed off on the project. </li>
<li>The Mayor has approved the project.</li>
<li>If funded, we will bring before Council. I have little doubt that it will receive a unanimous approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="confidence-in-securing-outside-funds-to-supplement-project">Confidence in securing outside funds to supplement project</h3>
<p>It&#39;s already secured. The City has said it will contribute 30 percent of what CfA does, and SmokeCartel at least $10,000. And we&#39;ve not even reached out to other sources yet.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>Sure, participatory budgeting may not be a new idea, but to my knowledge, this will be the largest PB project in terms of share of overall budget in U.S. history. Moreover, we are committed to this being an equitable process that takes active measures to reach people who historically haven&#39;t voted in municipal elections. Open Savannah has a very strong relationship with the entire Coastal Georgia civic ecosytem. Our Neighborhood Lead attends meetings on our behalf; our advisory board holds positions of influence; and we&#39;ve focused our first year on building relationships before apps. Process over product.</p>
<p>Moreover, if succesful, the City would no doubt repeat the project in future years. As the editor of <em>Connect Savannah</em> put it, leaders are desperate to the point of historic measures to regain the public&#39;s trust after the budget travails of the past two years and a growing &quot;civil war&quot; over gentrification and development projects.</p>
<p>with narrative hold the power to shift mindsets and inform and engage our communities. I believe information is power. </p>
<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I think most of the team I&#39;ve had the opportunity to meet already, but here goes it:</p>
<p>I’m a longtime data journalist and digital editor with a master’s degree in data and computational journalism from Columbia University who quit the professional journalism industry 1.5 years ago so that  I might have a greater impact outside of the newsroom –– where false balance matters often more than fact. I moved to Savannah 15 months ago after being in disbelief at the 2016 national election and the role my profession abandoned in the pursuit of pleasing the public rather than informing the public. I left  my job at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch with little other plans but to take on B.I. and mobile app work in Savannah, where I held my first job out of grad school as digital editor of Savannah Morning News. I was struck by the lack of available public data for a city of its size (~500,000 population).</p>
<p>So, I started a Meetup group. Before I knew it, I was leading a kickoff meeting before 75 residents who all shared my concerns. Thus, Open Savannah was born. And, boy, has it taken off!</p>
<p>I believe clear, nuanced communication between public sector actors and the residents who they serve is essential for healthy cities and healthy democracies , and that the problem breeding mistrust between city and citizen in 2018 is fundamentally a communication one (in addition to a cultural one). The procurement process is broken. Public trust is historically abysmal. Bureaucracy, which is a good thing in its purest form, has piled up so much over time that it now is part of the problem often. People feel  like their voices don’t matter. This breeds cynicism. This breeds mistrust. This leads us to vote for “anti-establishment” candidates who fecklessly proclaim to dismantle the institutions that have made our nation great. Democracy, while imperfect, is is in serious peril when this happens, and inefficient digital services are not only costly, but they disproportionately affect those living in the margins of our communities. </p>
<p>While we may not be able to fix the entirety of the broken system alone, together we can pull levers that help create positive microinteractions that make interacting with government not a pain or necessitating a day off work without paid leave just to qualify for the social safety net.</p>
<p>We can make this work.  We just have to approach it right and be leaders who do more than just code (but code is important too!).</p>
<h2 id="about-our-team">About our team</h2>
<p>Collaboration has been the key to Open Savannah&#39;s success so far, and I would argue its most killer app.</p>
<p>Take a look at our leadership team and advisory board (<a href="https://opensavannah.org/who-we-are" target="_blank">https://opensavannah.org/who-we-are</a>). Just our leadership alone is a powerhouse of local civic and local emerging technology and public sector movers-and-shakers.</p>
<p>As for the project team, I put out an open call for PB project volunteers two weeks ago. We&#39;ve received 32 interested participants.</p>
<p>We’ve met to discuss skills, needs, roles, etc., and we feel the following individuals would make strong fellows (including one who happens to be the guy who created Homebrew; no big!).</p>

<h1 id="addendum">ADDENDUM</h1>
<h3 id="why-participatory-budgeting-">Why participatory budgeting?</h3>
<p>A city’s annual municipal budget is said to be the truest reflection of its values. In 2018, the municipal budget in Savannah acted as a catalyst  for fomenting  widespread citizen distrust and an even more intractable  divide between city and citizen. </p>
<p>Given the opportunity to have a say over all $200 million is an accomplishment we are proud the City has entrusted us to carry out in collaboration with them. </p>
<p>Furthermore,  given the robust game developer ecosystem in Savannah, we have a unique opportunity to add gamification to the digital component of the project.</p>
<h3 id="alignment-with-city-plan">Alignment with city plan</h3>
<p>This, on its face, fits within the ‘Good Government’ bucket of the Savannah Forward Strategic Plan, but it goes beyond ‘good government’ toward aiming for ‘engaged citizens’ more specifically. While no mandate of any sort will exist to force the City adhere to the results of the PB process formally, all aspects of the voting and selection would be done in the open for the public to monitor during and after the PB process has finished in Aug/Sept..  </p>
